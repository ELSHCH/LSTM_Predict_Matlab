# LSTM model with extended Kalman Filter for advanced prediction of variations in climate data

Here LSTM networks with extenden Kalman Filter model is used for short-term forecast of climate data.
For training data physicochemical time series from on-site Boknis Eck observational data is used.
The model is applied to predict atmospheric wind as observed from near-to-surface wind at meteo-station.
The LSTM networks are complemeted with extended Kalman Filter.
